# QA_System

This contains the submission for Enzo Profili, with a NLP Q&A system using Business Insider article data for 2013/2014. Note that, in order to run the model in Profili_Enzo_QA_System, you have to change your path in python_functions.py (in the sentencetfidf function) to the path in which your Business Insider articles are located in. Thanks!
